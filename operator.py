# Operator n Python
# We have [+, -, *, /, //, %, **]

x = 10
y = 3

# plus aka addition operator
print (x + y)
# minus aka substraction
print (x + y)
# multiplication
print (x + y)
# division (return decimal)
print (x + y)
# divsion (return inrteger)
print (x + y)
# modulus (return remainder od the division)
print (x + y)
# exponent operaator
print (x**y) # res = x ^ y

# We have [+=, -=, *=, /=, ...] and we call assignment operator

# Comparison operaators [>, < , >=, <, ==, !=]
